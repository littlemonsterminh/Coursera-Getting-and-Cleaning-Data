#The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

# Download the dataset 
# Load the activity and feature info
# Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
# Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, 
# Merges into one dataset
# Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
# Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
# The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
